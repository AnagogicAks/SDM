### What is Source Control ?
Source cotrol is the tracking and management of changes to code. This ensures that developers are always working on the right version of source code.
Source control management (SCM) refers to tools that help you keep track of your code with a complete history of changes.

### Source Control vs. Source Code Management
These two terms are also used interchangeably. However, source control is specific to tracking changes in source code. While a source code management tool (SCM) tracks changes to a source code repository.

SCM also maintains a history of changes. This is used to resolve conflicts when merging updates from multiple developers.

### Why Source Control Is Important 
Source control is important for maintaining a single source of truth for development teams. Using it helps facilitate collaboration and accelerates release velocity.
Some benefits of source control are:

- It allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase.
- Developers can commit and merge code without conflicts.
- Developers can edit shared code without unknowingly overwriting each other’s work.


### 5 Tips for Source Control Management
Here are five tips to keep in mind:

- Choose the right system. (Helix Core is a great one.)
- Store your code in the system.
- Pull the latest version of the code.
- Commit code often (and make notes).
- Use branches to work in parallel.
- Choosing the right system is important — that’s why it’s the first best practice. 

### List of Source Control Management Tools
Source control tools include:

- Git
- Helix Core
- Subversion
- ClearCase
- Team Foundation Server
- Mercurial 
### Version Control with Git Is One Popular Option
Git source control is one of the most popular options. Some teams use open source Git. Others use enterprise Git. Some popular Git source control options include GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

### What Is Git?
It is a free, high-quality distributed version control system suitable for tracking modifications in source code in software development. It was originally created as an open-source system for coordinating tasks among programmers, but today it is widely used to track changes in any set of files. The key objectives of Git are as follows:

- Speed and efficiency
- Data integrity
- Support for distributed and non-linear workflows

### What Is GitHub?
It is a web-based Git repository. This hosting service has cloud-based storage. GitHub offers all distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git while adding its own features. It makes it easier to collaborate using Git. 

Additionally, GitHub repositories are open to the public. Developers worldwide can interact and contribute to one another’s code, modify or improve it, making GitHub a networking site for web professionals. The process of interaction and contribution is also called social coding.

### Git and GitHub Operate Completely Differently
The main Git vs GitHub difference is in their functionality. While they both provide source code management (SCM) and make merging and sharing code easier, this is pretty much where their similarities end. Think of Git as a single computer and GitHub as a network of multiple interconnected computers, all with the same end goal but a wildly different role for how to get there.

At its core, Git is a free, open-source software distributed version control system (DVCS) designed to manage all source code history. It can keep a history of commits, can reverse changes, and lets developers share code. Each developer must have Git installed on his or her local device to collaborate. It is commonly referred to as one of the best DevOps tools to understand and use in the developer space, and it’s among the most widely used tools today. Companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft use it, to name a few.

GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It offers all of Git’s DVCS SCM and has some additional features. This includes collaboration functionality like project management, support ticket management, and bug tracking. With GitHub, developers can share their repositories, access other developers’ repositories, and store remote copies of repositories to serve as backups.

### They Work in Different Environments
Another difference in comparison of Git vs GitHub is that the environment in which they operate. Git is installed locally on a system, so developers can manage their source code history using their local machines as repositories. This means there is no centralized server required to use Git, and no needed internet access either. Additionally, there’s no user-management system available and a proprietary desktop GUI.

GitHub, meanwhile, lives in the cloud, so Internet access is required. It also has a built-in user-management system and a user-friendly GUI. In addition to its main website, GitHub features a desktop version that can be installed on local computers to help synchronize code. It should be noted that Git can be used without GitHub, but GitHub cannot be used without Git. (GitHub primarily was built to work correctly with Git.)

### Both Git and GitHub Handle Commands Differently
Git developers themselves perform a command-line tool where code changes like commit and merge within the Git tool on their own local devices. By contrast, GitHub provides its cloud-based graphical interface where these tasks are performed. The interface also offers developers access control, collaboration features, and various task-management tools.

When it comes to commands, Git focuses exclusively on SCM tasks like push and pull, commit, reset, fetch, and merge. GitHub, meanwhile, serves as a host for Git repository teams to store their code in a centralized location. While Git is a tool that’s used to manage multiple versions of source code edits that are then transferred to files in a Git repository, GitHub serves as a location for uploading copies of a Git repository.

### They’re Owned by Different Companies
Git has remained an open-source tool since it was first released in 2005. To this day, it is maintained by the Linux Foundation as part of the open-source ecosystem of tools and technologies (the Linux founder also created Git). By contrast, GitHub was launched as a company in 2008 and acquired by Microsoft in 2018.
