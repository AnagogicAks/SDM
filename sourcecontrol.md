### What is Source Control ?
Source cotrol is the tracking and management of changes to code. This ensures that developers are always working on the right version of source code.
Source control management (SCM) refers to tools that help you keep track of your code with a complete history of changes.

### Source Control vs. Source Code Management
These two terms are also used interchangeably. However, source control is specific to tracking changes in source code. While a source code management tool (SCM) tracks changes to a source code repository.

SCM also maintains a history of changes. This is used to resolve conflicts when merging updates from multiple developers.

### Why Source Control Is Important 
Source control is important for maintaining a single source of truth for development teams. Using it helps facilitate collaboration and accelerates release velocity.
Some benefits of source control are:

- It allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase.
- Developers can commit and merge code without conflicts.
- Developers can edit shared code without unknowingly overwriting each other’s work.


### 5 Tips for Source Control Management
Here are five tips to keep in mind:

- Choose the right system. (Helix Core is a great one.)
- Store your code in the system.
- Pull the latest version of the code.
- Commit code often (and make notes).
- Use branches to work in parallel.
- Choosing the right system is important — that’s why it’s the first best practice. 

### List of Source Control Management Tools
Source control tools include:

- Git
- Helix Core
- Subversion
- ClearCase
- Team Foundation Server
- Mercurial 
### Version Control with Git Is One Popular Option
Git source control is one of the most popular options. Some teams use open source Git. Others use enterprise Git. Some popular Git source control options include GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
